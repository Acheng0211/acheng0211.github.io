Research Experience
======
* <big>**Design Principle and Motion Control Simulation of Pseudo-open-chain Mechanism of Overconstrained Quadruped Robot Limb** *(in progress)*</big>
<div style="text-align: right;">Supervised by <b>Prof. Chaoyang Song</b>, Shenzhen, China, Sep 2024 - present</div>

<br>  

* <big>**Investigating Overconstrained Locomotion using Reinforcement Learning**</big>
    *	Minimized physical collisions of the model to reduce computational overhead for 38%.
    -	Wrote 1088 lines code in total for configuring the robot's physical properties, initial position, motor parameters, environment integration, articulation motion rate adjustment, random state addition, and reward function design.
    -	Published an **ISRR** paper and a **ReMAR** paper
    -	Won 3 prizes of 23rd National CURC RoboCon 2024 Bionic Foot Robot Challenge, and the “Challenge Cup” Guangdong College Student Entrepreneurship Plan Competition Gold Award(0.4%)
