I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/), [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). My research interest includes robotics, Over-constrained mechanism, quadruped robot and reinforcement learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chaoyang Song](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/songchaoyang.html) of [BionicsDL Lab](https://bionicdl.ancorasir.com/) from [Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/), SUSTech. I was advised by [Prof. Chenglong Fu](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/fuchenglong.html) from [Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), SUSTech.
