I'm a Robotics MSE student in [The Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR)](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). I earned my bachelor degree in [Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en) of [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), majoring in Robotics Engineering. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chaoyang Song](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/songchaoyang.html) of [BionicDL Lab](https://bionicdl.ancorasir.com/) and [Prof. Chenglong Fu](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/fuchenglong.html) from [Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/) during my undergraduate life. I have worked on several projects related to quadruped locomotion, FES system design, and mixed-reality HRI.

<!-- I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/), [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). My research interest includes robotics, Over-constrained mechanism, quadruped robot and reinforcement learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chaoyang Song](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/songchaoyang.html) of [BionicDL Lab](https://bionicdl.ancorasir.com/) from [Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/), SUSTech since 2023. Meanwhile, I was advised by [Prof. Chenglong Fu](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/fuchenglong.html) from [Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/), SUSTech from 2022 to 2024. -->
